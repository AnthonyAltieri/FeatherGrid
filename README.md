FeatherGrid was built in order to provide the most amount of utility for the least amount of weight on your website's page size because of this the minified version of FeatherGrid is **567 bytes**!  
  
This is an ongoing project of mine that was created out of curiousity to see how lightweight I could make a utility style library that would hit most browsers without adding any significant bloat. According to [CanIUse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox) FeatherGrid is supported by 94.1% of browsers used by all internet users; while this is probably an overestimate there is a high chance that an end-user can use your site unimpaired.
